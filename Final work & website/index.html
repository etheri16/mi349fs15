			<h2>Season</h2>
			<p>
				I had high hopes for my team this year, ive been a lions fan for 12 plus years and its the same results every year. We started off the season 1-7, very disappointing. After the horrible start the team owner fired the offensive coordinator, General manager and team president. Which in my eyes was a very long over due move. Since the firings the lions have gone 3-1.

			<h3> Offense </h3>
			<p>
				After the horrifc 1-7 start and our offense not living up to it's potential the front office decided to fire our offensive coordinator. We decided to promote out offensive lineman coach to the position and ever since then our offense has been clicking.

			<h3>head coach</h3>
			<p>
				Jim caldwell our head coach has had a tough season. After going 1-7 many used him to blame for the teams struggle. He was basically used as a cape goat for the teams struggles. With the team being 4-8 its sad to say his job is in jeapordy, The owner and the fans want to win and after so many losing sesons we deserve it"
